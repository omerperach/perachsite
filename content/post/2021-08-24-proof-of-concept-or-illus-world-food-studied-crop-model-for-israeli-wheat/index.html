<div id="what-is-wofost" class="section level2">
<h2>What is WOFOST?</h2>
<p>WOFOST is a simulation model for the quantitative analysis of the growth and production of annual field crops <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/show/A-gentle-introduction-to-WOFOST.htm">Please read</a>. WOFOST could basically help us to understand the dynamic of the plant biological features such as <strong>Leaf area index</strong>, <strong>Biomass</strong>, <strong>Water use</strong>, <strong>Yield</strong> etc. for a location given knowledge about soil, crop, weather and crop management.</p>
</div>
<div id="application-of-wofost" class="section level2">
<h2>Application of WOFOST</h2>
<ul>
<li>yield risk and inter- annual yield variability.</li>
<li>yield variability over soil types, or over a range of agro-hydrological conditions.</li>
<li>fifferences among cultivars.</li>
<li>relative importance of growth determining factors.</li>
<li>Many more</li>
</ul>

<div id="my-plan" class="section level2">
<h2>My plan</h2>
<p>WOFOST is a huge and amazing project and I am on the very early stage of learning it. Nonetheless, I believe in learning from doing so I decided to try and take a new R package <em>Rwofost</em> and use it. This R package trying to implement the WOFOST model in the R environment. It is worth mentioning that their is a python shell that are more suitable to work with that model <a href="https://pcse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Please read</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-parameters-the-package-functions-need-to-recieve" class="section level2">
<h2>What parameters the package functions need to recieve?</h2>
<p>The mandatory variables for the functions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>crop - which crop I want to model. from a list.</p></li>
<li><p>whether - weather data set with the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>date-“Date” class variable in R.</li>
<li>srad-Solar radiation kJ m^-2 day^-1.</li>
<li>tmin-minimum temperature per day (degrees C).</li>
<li>tmax-maximum temperature per day (degrees C).</li>
<li>vapr-vapor pressure (kPa).</li>
<li>wind-wind speed (m s^-1).</li>
<li>prec-precipitation (mm day^-1).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="first-stage---single-station" class="section level2">
<h2>First stage - single station</h2>
<p>In the first stage I will only collect data for a single station. I decided to focus in a data from a station called <em>Gilat</em>. The station located near a small toen called <em>Ofakim</em>. The reasons I am choosing to work on this station are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The soil type in that reason is clay.</li>
<li>The area is good representative of a place with annual field crops.</li>
<li>I have a knowledge on chickpea development grown over there on 2021 season.</li>
</ul>
