I love trekking and I love to check geographical maps while doing it. Lately I encountered an R package named **rayshader** and I overwhelmed from its ability to create beautiful 3D map visualization in R. This tutorial goal is to download tif satellite pictures and to show the Dolomite Alta Via 1 trek 3D path with **rayshader* package.
