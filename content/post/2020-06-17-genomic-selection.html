<p>Hi there, I am excited!!!</p>
<p>What a beutiful subject to start with.</p>
<p>Supervised learning is the giant wave, storm, eathquake in almost every digital industry.</p>
<p>But what about non-tech industry? What about the agriculture and the breeding industries?</p>
<p>It starting to get warm, at least in the farming industry. A lot of companies aiming to retrieve data from the field such as aerial photography, soil water potential, satelite that can tract field temperature and soil radation.</p>
<p>All for one point - achieve better yield with less resources.</p>
<p>Yes, the farmer will be able to increase yield and lower operating expnse thus to increae revenue.</p>
<p>All of these endeavors have grat challenges and times will tell if the money to buy the technology will indeed help the famers.</p>
<p>Some of the Israeli most interesting companies are: Prospera, Taranis, SeeTree, CropX.</p>
<p>To be honest, we need to disrupt the gene to phenotype challenge in order to feed 10 the world in the future</p>
<p>How we will do it? you will need to continue readingâ€¦</p>
