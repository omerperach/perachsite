<h1>The incentive</h1>
<p>If you do not know it, there are satellites in the sky:)<br />
I am joking, most of us are aware about it, but I donâ€™t think that most of us are aware that satellites traveling in the sky and taking pictures that we could download and process.<br />
<strong>This post is to teach you how to download data from a satellite called Sentinel and to process it</strong></p>

<div id="how-to-dowanload-the-images" class="section level1">
<h1>How to dowanload the images</h1>
<p>There are bunch of R packages that can help you to download images from many free satellites such as:<br />
1. RGIStools<br />
2. getspatialdata<br />
3. sen2r (only for Sentinel)<br />
I used sen2r to download the images.
what I love in sent2 is the shiny GUI interface they build in order to help you download the data. I will suggest you to read this <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300419304893?via%3Dihub">link</a> - it explaining the basic information for knowing how to use it.
I will not go into it in this post but if you would like me to elaborate on it, please contact me.<br />
