      <description>Hi there, I am excited!!!
What a beutiful subject to start with.
Supervised learning is the giant wave, storm, eathquake in almost every digital industry.
But what about non-tech industry? What about the agriculture and the breeding industries?
It starting to get warm, at least in the farming industry. A lot of companies aiming to retrieve data from the field such as aerial photography, soil water potential, satelite that can tract field temperature and soil radation.</description>
