      <description>You are a plant breeder, you in the end of collecting all the data for a long and exhaustive four year project with the goal to find the crop lines with the best traits for the customers.
Let’s take a data set from the agridat package:
The data is a field trial on 58 varieties of soybean, grown in four locations across two years in Australia.Now we look on the six first rows of the data:</description>

      <description>You should install the following packages before running the code in this work:
install.packages(&amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;)install.packages(&amp;quot;pROC&amp;quot;)install.packages(&amp;quot;ggplot2&amp;quot;)Basic model estimate: the case with FICO score onlyFirst, we will load the Assignment_1_data.csv to R.dplyr R library will be used in the process in order to manipulate the data frame.

      <description>RFM analysis - IntroductionRFM helps to identify customers who are more likely to respond to promotions by segmenting them into various categories.We will use the rfm package. We will read the csv file RFM_data.csv and calculate RFM scores for each customer.The data include 39999 observations of:1. Customer I.D2. Recencency Days3. Number of Orders4. Total Revenue5. Most Recent Visit Will not be usedFour bins will be used for recency, frequency and monetary.</description>

      <description>The Challenge PurposeCommercial corn is one of the most important crops in the world.Every year plant breeders produce new corn products known as hybrids. Those hybrids are the products of crossing two “parents” called inbred. The most demanding and resource consuming procedure is to develop inbreds and subsequently assess the crossing outcome - hybrid - of one inbred to another inbred called ‘tester’.
The importance of this projectOn 2050 world population will approximately be 10 billion people.</description>
