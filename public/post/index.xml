      <description>I love trekking and I love to check geographical maps while doing it. Lately I encountered an R package named rayshader and I overwhelmed from its ability to create beautiful 3D map visualization in R. This tutorial goal is to download tif satellite pictures and to show the Dolomite Alta Via 1 trek 3D path with **rayshader* package.</description>

      <description>Going back to a time series bike sharing datasetDuring my MBA studies we received a final project in Exploratory data analysis course. The project was on a data set of a bike sharing. It is quite a famous data set that contains the hourly count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.
The course instructors want us to focus mainly on the exploratory data analysis of the data set and to try to infer important insight on each variable and their interaction with each other in order to make the best prediction model.</description>

      <description>The united states department of agriculture published a report (Oct-2016) which assessed the adoption of precision agriculture (PA) technologies by farmers in addition to how it impact the farm profit.
The bottom line - The impact of these PA technologies on profits for U.S. corn producers is positive, but small.
There is a big hype in precision agriculture technologies and many Israeli start-ups working in that field.
Some Israeli startups in the field of precision agricultureProsperaTaranisViridixCropxSeeTreeTrieyeFarmigoSaturasThe blog will:Show you how to query the ARMS database with rarms package in order undertand the USA farm industry - if you wish to penetrate that market.</description>

      <description>Executive SummaryWorldwide climate change and decrease in arable lands and lands under permanent crops constitute a majorconcern for future food safety. Private and government based breeding programs working constantly to developelite crops in order to meet the future demand to feed 10 billion people by 2050. Under these constraints, to meet the rising demand for food, agricultural production must increase by an estimated 50% without greatly increasing water usage or expanding the total land area dedicated to agriculture.</description>

      <description>You are a plant breeder, you in the end of collecting all the data for a long and exhaustive four year project with the goal to find the crop lines with the best traits for the customers.
Let’s take a data set from the agridat package:
The data is a field trial on 58 varieties of soybean, grown in four locations across two years in Australia.Now we look on the six first rows of the data:</description>

      <description>RFM analysis - IntroductionRFM helps to identify customers who are more likely to respond to promotions by segmenting them into various categories.We will use the rfm package. We will read the csv file RFM_data.csv and calculate RFM scores for each customer.The data include 39999 observations of:1. Customer I.D2. Recencency Days3. Number of Orders4. Total Revenue5. Most Recent Visit Will not be usedFour bins will be used for recency, frequency and monetary.</description>

      <description>The Challenge PurposeCommercial corn is one of the most important crops in the world.Every year plant breeders produce new corn products known as hybrids. Those hybrids are the products of crossing two “parents” called inbred. The most demanding and resource consuming procedure is to develop inbreds and subsequently assess the crossing outcome - hybrid - of one inbred to another inbred called ‘tester’.
The importance of this projectOn 2050 world population will approximately be 10 billion people.</description>
