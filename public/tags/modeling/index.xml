      <description>What is WOFOST?WOFOST is a simulation model for the quantitative analysis of the growth and production of annual field crops Please read. WOFOST could basically help us to understand the dynamic of the plant biological features such as Leaf area index, Biomass, Water use, Yield etc. for a location given knowledge about soil, crop, weather and crop management.
Application of WOFOSTYield risk and inter- annual yield variability.</description>
