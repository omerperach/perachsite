      <description>Going back to a time series bike sharing datasetDuring my MBA studies we received a final project in Exploratory data analysis course. The project was on a data set of a bike sharing. It is quite a famous data set that contains the hourly count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.
The course instructors want us to focus mainly on the exploratory data analysis of the data set and to try to infer important insight on each variable and their interaction with each other in order to make the best prediction model.</description>
